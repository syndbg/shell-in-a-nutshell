# Intro

## Why would you use shell script?

Shell scripting is really useful if you want to automate tasks involving shell commands. However don't rely on shell scripts for arithmetics, strings, databases and other complex tasks. Use `C` or other `high-level languages`.

It comes in handy in every aspect of Linux. It's the same syntax you use in your shell (console/terminal) and understanding it will boost your productivity in the long run.
